# Windows Rust Bluetooth Manager

Aims to recreate macos menu bar bluetooth manager.

## Features
- [x] sits in tray
- [x] toggles bluetooth on/off
- [ ] shows connected devices and battery level (if available)
- [ ] scan for new devices
- [ ] connect to devices
- [ ] forget devices
- [ ] temporary disconnect
- [ ] optional autolaunch on startup

## Why?
I always found it weird that one cannot simply pin a Bluetooth Icon in windows` tray — once you switch bt off - it's gone.
